TPTEST engine changelog
-----------------------


Version 3.15:

 - Modified TPEngine struct to include "UINT32 start_tcpsend_bytes" and 
   "UINT32 start_tcprecv_bytes", which are used by tpclient.c:AdvanceTest() 
   as start values for tcpBytes when doing TCP send and receive tests.
   Previously, the values were a #define (START_TCP_BYTES).

   This modification allows a (TPTEST/Statistik) client program to perform
   auto-TCP tests more effectively.

 - Added "char email[101]" and "char pwd[101]" to TPEngine struct.
   (more TPTEST/Statistik support).

 - Stat reports now include "email=x;pwd=y" also, no matter if email or
   pwd exists/is used or not.

 - New test modes supported by AdvanceTest(): 
   M_TCP_AUTO, M_TCP_AUTO_SEND, M_TCP_AUTO_RECV


Version 3.16:

 - Added "int socket_sndbuf, socket_rcvbuf, cur_socket_sndbuf, cur_socket_rcvbuf"
   to TPEngine struct. socket_sndbuf/socket_rcvbuf are used by the application
   to tell the IO module that it would like certain SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF values
   set for data sockets (only. The control socket will use default values for
   SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF). If the IO module sees that these variables are non-zero
   it should try to set the send- and receive buffers for new data sockets
   accordingly. The IO module should also do a getsockopt() or similar, asking
   for the actual SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF values used (after trying to set them) and 
   store the results in cur_socket_rcvbuf/cur_socket_sndbuf. The application may
   then determine what buffer settings were actually used for the test.

   Note that data sockets aren't created by the engine until a test has been
   initiated and test parameters have been negotiated between client and server.
   This means that an application has to e.g. wait until the engine state is
   "engp->state == CLSM_TESTLOOP" before checking what actual values for
   SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF are used.

   Also worth knowing is that SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF are used by most Unix-like
   OS's to determine TCP window size. Setting both values to e.g. 65536 on both
   the client and server side will cause the machines to negotiate that value
   for the TCP window size when the data connection is set up in a TCP test.


Version 3.18:

 - Added "local_tcp_pr_start, local_tcp_pr_end, local_udp_pr_start, local_udp_pr_end"
   to TPEngine struct. These variables are used by the I/O modules to allocate local
   port number from a certain range for the local data sockets. 

   Note that currently, only the Unix I/O module supports these variables so
   a server using the Windows or MacOS I/O modules will not be able to use
   the feature.
